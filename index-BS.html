                            <p>Welcome! Raised in an Italian kitchen, it will always be my place of refuge.  I love all things "food."  Sunday dinners, Christmas baking, family gatherings...I'm in!  I gravitate towards the puzzle, the hunt for the solution.  It travels through everything I am.  I love to shop, be it grocery or other but love to search a good deal.  I began my career in retail but moved into Operations - where everyday is an adventure, a puzzle.  </p>
                            <p>Professionally, I am an adaptable and organized professional with over 25 years of career progression in operations and customer service management. Effective at liaising with key clients, accounts and external business stakeholders, I offer the ability to leverage trends across industries to derive solutions and approaches focused on creating value for customers and profitability for company. I have a demonstrated ability to streamline processes and improving throughput through continuous modifications and cross-functional collaboration for efficiency and productivity.  I am focused and meticulous in all financial and regulatory compliance objectives to strategically plan and execute budgets, cost-reduction techniques and safety initiatives. I have a strong history of devising precise and targeted business operations plans, managing multifaceted areas, reviewing performance and driving change. I energetically address customer requests and concerns to provide relevant information and options. Handle difficult situations with grace through resourcefulness and adaptability. I have and will continue to persistently shape high-performing teams and inspiring staff to achieve personal as well as professional goals.</p>
