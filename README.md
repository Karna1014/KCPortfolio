# KCPortfolio


**Description:**

A professional site showcasing my best works to date.  It includes a short Bio and a contact page along with links to my resume, Github site, and LinkedIn profile. Each work example includes a short description and a link to both the deployed web page, as well as the Github site where perspective employers or clients can view my Portfolio.

Usage:
It will be the first Point of Contact where I can showcase my applications to perspective employers/clients in multiple mediums. This will demonstrate my strongest work and will lead to employment.
